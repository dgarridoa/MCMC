# MCMC

Examples of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). All these examples are from Murphy, K. P. (2012). Machine learning: a probabilistic perspective. MIT press.

These examples include:
- Metropolis Hasting for sampling from a mixture of two 1D Gaussians. Example from section.
- Gibbs Sampling for sampling from a 2D Gaussian
- Gibbs sampling for a 1D Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)
